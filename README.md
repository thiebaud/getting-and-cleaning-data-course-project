# getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
Week 4 assignment for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data class.

This repository was created to fulfill the requirements for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project.  It contains three files:  The README (you are here), the run_analysis.R code for reading in and tidying the UCI HAR dataset, and the tidied dataset resulting from running that code.


The data tidying consists of 6 steps as follows:

Step 0: Read in the assorted input files.
Step 1: Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Step 2: Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step 3: Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Step 4: Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
Step 5: From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
