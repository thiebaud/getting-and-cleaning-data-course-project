# getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
Week 4 assignment for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data class.

This repository was created to fulfill the requirements for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project.  It contains three files:  The README (you are here), the run_analysis.R code for reading in and tidying the UCI HAR dataset, and the tidied dataset resulting from running that code.
